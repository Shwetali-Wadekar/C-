	Complex Polynomial Solver (Advanced Level)
	
	Objective: Solve and manipulate polynomial equations using complex numbers.
	
	Concepts Covered:
	Unary operators (-, !).
	Subscript operator ([]).
	Function call operator (()).
	
	Task Description
	Create a Polynomial class to represent a polynomial equation.
	
	Overload the following operators:
	- (Unary): Negate all coefficients of the polynomial.
	!: Return the degree of the polynomial.
	
	[]: Access or modify the coefficient of a specific term (e.g., p[2] for the coefficient of  x^2).
	
	(): Evaluate the polynomial for a given value of x.
	
	Expected Output:
	Input:
	Polynomial: 2x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 5
	Evaluate for x = 2
	
	Output:
	Value: 27
	Degree: 3
	Negated Polynomial: -2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5s
