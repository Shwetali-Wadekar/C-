Problem Statement
Design a Library system to manage books using constructors and destructors.
The assignment must cover:

Default Constructor: Initialize with default values.

Parameterized Constructor: Initialize with specific values.

Copy Constructor: Implement deep copy to handle dynamic memory.

Destructor: Ensure proper cleanup of dynamically allocated memory.
this Pointer: Demonstrate the use of the this pointer.
Constant Objects and Member Functions: Use const for specific member functions that do not modify the object.
Shallow vs. Deep Copy: Explain and demonstrate these concepts.
Features to Implement
Attributes:

bookID (integer): Unique ID for the book.
title (pointer to a dynamically allocated string): Title of the book.
author (string): Author of the book.
price (float): Price of the book.
Functions:

Constructors:
Default constructor to initialize default values.
Parameterized constructor to initialize specific values.
Copy Constructor:
Deep copy to handle dynamic memory allocation.

Destructor:
Releases dynamically allocated memory.

Member Functions:
setDetails: Updates book details (uses this pointer).
displayDetails: Displays book details (mark as const).

Testing:
Create default, parameterized, and copied objects.
Modify and display book details.

+-------------------------+


Default Constructor:
Book ID: 0
Title: Not Set
Author: Unknown
Price: $0.00

Parameterized Constructor:
Book ID: 101
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Price: $10.99

Copy Constructor:
Book ID: 101
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Price: $10.99

After Modifying Copy:
Book ID: 102
Title: Moby Dick
Author: Herman Melville
Price: $15.99

Original Unchanged:
Book ID: 101
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Price: $10.99


Breakdown of Subtasks

Easy:
Create objects using the default constructor and parameterized constructor.
Use displayDetails to print book details.

Moderate:
Implement a deep copy using the copy constructor.
Test shallow copy vs. deep copy by modifying copied objects.

Hard:
Demonstrate this pointer in the setDetails method.
Use const with the displayDetails function and try accessing const and non-const objects.
