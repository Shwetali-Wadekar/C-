Create a Loan class that models a bank loan system. The class should have:

+--------------------------+

+--------------------------+
| - loanID: int            |
| - borrowerName: string   |
| - loanAmount: float      |
| - interestRate: float    |
+--------------------------+
| + Loan(...)              |
| + calculateEMI(...):     |
|   void                  |
| + displayDetails():      |
|   void                   |
+--------------------------+


Data Members:

loanID (integer): Unique identifier for each loan.
borrowerName (string): Name of the borrower.

Member Functions:

A constructor to initialize loan details.
A function calculateEMI to compute the monthly EMI based on a tenure in years (formula provided in the header file).

EMI= P x r x ((1+r)^n ) / ((1+r)^n) - 1


 
Where:

P: Loan Amount

r: Monthly interest rate (AnnualÂ Rate/12)

n: Tenure in months
